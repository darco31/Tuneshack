# Deployment

The live deployed application can be found here 

### Gitpod and GitHub

To use the terminal designed by The Code Institute I used the [Code Institute Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
This allows the code that is used to run the terminal be viewed in the browser.

### Steps:

* Click create new repository.
* Give the repository a name.
* Under Repository template pick the [Code Institute Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
* Click create repository
- Use GIT ADD .
- GIT COMMIT -m "Comments"
- GIT PUSH
- To commit the code and push to Github

## Forking the Github Repository

- Locate the desired Github repository.
- In the top right corner click the Fork button.
- The repository has been forked and you can now work 0on the copy.

## Cloning a Github repository

- Locate the desired Github repository.
- Use the code button and copy the link.
- Open Gitpod and select your directory where you want the clone to be created.
- Type git clone in the terminal and paste the link in.
- The clone will be created


### Creating an Application with Heroku

I used the video tutorial provided by The Code Institute to create a Heroku account, add the details of the app and deploy the application to a live environment.

- Log in to Heroku [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)
- Click New 
- Give the app a name and choose the region
- Click on settings first and set the Reveal Config Vars
- Click Deploy at the top to go to the Deployment settings
- Choose GiHub as the deployment method
- Search for your app and connect
- Use Automatic deploys if you would like a new build when changes are pushed to GitHub from Gitpod
- Use Manual deploy for a new build every time this button is clicked.
- Once completed click View App

# Deployment

The live deployed application can be found here [TuneShack](https://tuneshack22.herokuapp.com/)

### Gitpod and GitHub

To use the terminal designed by The Code Institute I used the [Code Institute Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
This allows the code that is used to run the terminal be viewed in the browser.

### Steps:

* Click create new repository.
* Give the repository a name.
* Under Repository template pick the [Code Institute Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
* Click create repository
- Use GIT ADD .
- GIT COMMIT -m "Comments"
- GIT PUSH
- To commit the code and push to Github

## Forking the Github Repository

- Locate the desired Github repository.
- In the top right corner click the Fork button.
- The repository has been forked and you can now work 0on the copy.

## Cloning a Github repository

- Locate the desired Github repository.
- Use the code button and copy the link.
- Open Gitpod and select your directory where you want the clone to be created.
- Type git clone in the terminal and paste the link in.
- The clone will be created


### Creating an Application with Heroku

I used the video tutorial provided by The Code Institute to create a Heroku account, add the details of the app and deploy the application to a live environment.

- Log in to Heroku [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)
- Click New 
- Give the app a name and choose the region
- Click on settings first and set the Reveal Config Vars
- Click Deploy at the top to go to the Deployment settings
- Choose GiHub as the deployment method
- Search for your app and connect
- Use Automatic deploys if you would like a new build when changes are pushed to GitHub from Gitpod
- Use Manual deploy for a new build every time this button is clicked.
- Once completed click View App

### Updated as Heroku had a security breach and deployment was needed to be completed from the Github CLI.

* Deploying your app to heroku
1. Login to heroku and enter your details.
command: heroku login -i
2. Get your app name from heroku.
command: heroku apps
3. Set the heroku remote. (Replace <app_name> with your actual app name)
command: heroku git:remote -a <app_name>
4. Add, commit and push to github
command: git add . && git commit -m "Deploy to Heroku via CLI"
5. Push to both github and heroku
command: git push origin main
command: git push heroku main


* MFA/2FA enabled?
1. Click on Account Settings (under the avatar menu)
2. Scroll down to the API Key section and click Reveal. Copy the key.
3. Enter the command: heroku_config , and enter your api key you copied when prompted
4. Complete the steps above, if you see an input box at the top middle of the editor...
 a. enter your heroku username
 b. enter the api key you just copied
